## Define the problem

**RMS Titanic** was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time. It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.

There are various reasons that the shipwreck led to huge loss of lives. In this project, we are going to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive or not.
